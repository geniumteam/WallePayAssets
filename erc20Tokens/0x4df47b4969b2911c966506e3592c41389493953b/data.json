The platform allows developers to fix bugs or to program additional features for an existing application.\nFundRequest will be developed on the Ethereum Blockchain, and aims to leverage upon a decentralized ecosystem as it reduces both operational and regulatory burdens and protects against organisational corruption such as fraud and embezzlement. FundRequest creates smart contracts to incentivize developers to solve a problem in the open source community.","name":"FundRequest"}
