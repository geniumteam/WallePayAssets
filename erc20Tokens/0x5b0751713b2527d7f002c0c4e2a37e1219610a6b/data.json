Users bet on a coin/token that performs the best among all the other competing ones in a specific time period. Bets are placed and rewards are claimed using Metamask plugin for Chrome/Firefox or the Ethereum based Mist browser. Being completely secured by the blockchain, no one has control over the race or user funds once a contract is deployed and a race is announced.","name":"Horse"}
