Although the amount of FANZ tokens are finite, whitelisted-partners can use the DApp to stamp FANZ tokens in their possession, opening new possibilities to engage and activate fans. What’s more, the API makes it easy to integrate FanChain into existing legacy systems, essentially creating “FanChain-as-service” functionality.","name":"FanChain"}
