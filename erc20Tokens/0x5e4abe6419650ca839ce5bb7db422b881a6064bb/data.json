Millions of people use and share their WiFi connections everyday without realizing the potential monetary benefit they can get through it. With CryptoWi, we solve this by letting any user sell/rent his WiFi connection to those in need and be rewarded in Wi Coins (WiC), the in-app currency.","name":"Wi Coin"}
