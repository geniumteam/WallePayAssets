Bitcoin is converted to fiat on-the-go, using a true peer-to-peer exchange on the Ethereum network.\nPlutons are digital tokens you earn as a reward for shopping with Plutus. Just like cash back or air miles on a credit card, the more you spend the more you earn. (We&rsquo;re merchant agnostic, so every purchase counts).\nPlutons you earn (or purchase early) will be available to convert on the Plutus exchange network, allowing you to make in-store purchases with zero fees on conversion.","name":"Pluton"}
